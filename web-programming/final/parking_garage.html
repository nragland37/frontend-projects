      <p>
        In the early years of Webster, few students owned cars. A streetcar
        stopped in front of Webster Hall on Lockwood Avenue and provided
        convenient service for the "dayhops" as commuter students were once
        called.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enrollment at Webster increased steadily over time. The commuter
        population also grew and more students owned cars. Like many
        universities, Webster experienced an increased demand for parking.
      </p>

        The decision to build a parking garage was connected to another
        decision—the move to build a library on the main campus. Since the site
        of the future
        <a

        >
        included a parking lot along Edgar Road, the university had to replace
        those lost spots. The new parking lot opened the last week in September,
        2001, about a month before ground was broken for the new library. The
        structure cost approximately $6.5 million and provided 675 parking
        spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        The garage was expanded to add 550 more parking spots. The new section
        of the garage opened on May 2, 2017.
