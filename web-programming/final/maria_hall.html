        Webster University made the decision to construct a new dormitory almost
        30 years after the first one, Loretto Hall, opened. According to a local
        newspaper, Maria Hall was designed by the architects A.F. and Arthur
        Stauder and built by Hankins Construction Company. ("Webster to dedicate
        residence hall", p. 10B.) The article went on to describe the dorm rooms
        as featuring "varied pastel colors, blond wood furniture, colorful
        leather upholstery, traverse draperies and adjoining tile baths."
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides providing over 100 additional dorm rooms, the proposed building
        included plans for a large dining room which could accommodate the
        residents and day students (commuters) at the same time, something not
        possible in Loretto Hall. The new building also provided additional
        storage and office areas as well as a recreational area.
      </p>
      <p>
        A contest to select a name for the new building was announced in the
        student newspaper in 1957 and students and faculty were invited to
        participate ("President reveals name-the-wing contest"). The only
        restriction was that the building could not be named after Father
        Nerinckx, founder of the Sisters of Loretto, the religious order that
        established Webster in 1915. The administration wanted to avoid
        confusion with nearby Nerinx Hall. The name Maria Hall was chosen in
        spring 1958 ("New wing named Maria Hall").
      </p>
      <p>
        Maria Hall opened in the fall of 1959. A dedication ceremony was held on
        November 15, 1959 and included an address by Archbishop Joseph Ritter of
        St. Louis.
