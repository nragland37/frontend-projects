        The Music Building was originally the residence of Frank and Mattie
        Thompson. It was built in 1910 by James P. Jamieson, who at the time
        worked for the Philadelphia architectural firm of Cope and Stewardson.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Thompsons called their home "Arbor Lodge". Mr. Thompson was chairman
        of the board of Carondelet Foundry. Mrs. Thompson died in 1939. When
        Frank Thompson died in 1941, he left his estate to the Episcopal Church.
        The Thompson House became the home of Bishop William Scarlett, the head
        of the Episcopal Diocese of Missouri. Bishop and Mrs. Scarlett lived
        there until his retirement in 1952.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the Scarletts' most prominent visitor during their time at the
        residence was Eleanor Roosevelt. She stayed for a few days in March
        1949. In her "My Day" column of March 15, 1949, she wrote: "The bishop's
        house is a delightful home flooded with sunshine and with pleasant
        grounds around it... The visitors who are really catered to, however,
        are the birds. They have houses and feeding stations all around..."
      </p>
      <p>
        From 1952-1960, the building was used as a retreat center for the
        Episcopal Church. Webster President Sr. Francetta Barberis approached
        Rt. Reverend George L. Cadigan, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of
        Missouri, about the possibility of purchasing the property for the
        college. Because of Mr. Thompson's will, the property could not be sold
        but could be exchanged for another piece of land. The college purchased
        the estate of Bertram B. Culver (president of the Wrought Iron Range
        Company) located near Ballas and Ladue Roads for $200,000 and exchanged
        it for the Thompson property in September 1960.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once Webster College acquired the property, a renovation was undertaken
        to make it suitable for classroom use. The renovation has overseen by
        Hellmuth, Obata, and Kassabaum, architects.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Music Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places
        as part of the Webster College-Eden Theological Seminary Collegiate
        District on December 28, 1982. A ceremony honoring the recognition of
        this historic district was held June 29, 1984.
