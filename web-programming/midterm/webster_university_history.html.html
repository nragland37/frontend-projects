              <p>
                In the early days of the American frontier, poor children were
                forgotten when it came to education. The Sisters of Loretto, a
                Catholic religious organization founded in 1812, set out to
                offer a solution.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Loretto Community dedicated itself to providing education to
                those who normally might not possess an opportunity to obtain
                one. It's this mission that remains at the heart of Webster
                University today.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Sisters of Loretto laid the cornerstone for Webster
                University on Nov. 1, 1915. Originally named Loretto College,
                the school was one of the first Catholic women's colleges west
                of the Mississippi River. It was progressive for its time,
                providing higher education to women when it was not generally
                made available.
              </p>
              <p>
                Loretto College opened with eight Sisters of Loretto teaching
                class for five students. Two students populated the first
                graduating class in 1919.
              </p>
              <p>
                Five years later, in 1924, the school changed its name to
                Webster College to avoid confusion with Loretto Academy, a
                school operated by the Loretto Community on Lafayette Avenue in
                St. Louis. The North Central Association of Colleges and
                Secondary Schools accredited Webster College the same year.

              <p>
                After struggling through the depressed economy of the 1930s,
                Webster College saw gradual growth in the 1940s and 50s. Student
                enrollment started to climb and the physical dimensions of the
                campus continued to expand beyond Webster and Loretto halls.
              </p>
              <p>
                But it was the 1960s that saw the most change at Webster
                College.
              </p>
              <p>
                Webster opened its doors to its first male students in 1962. Two
                men enrolled that first year, although the list of available
                classes for men remained limited. Six years later the school
                went fully coeducational with no restrictions on the number of
                classes male students could take.
              </p>
              <p>
                A grant from the Ford Foundation allowed Webster College to
                launch its Master of Arts in Teaching program in 1963. The
                program sought to provide a master's program for teaching
                professionals who couldn't afford to abandon their everyday
                work. It was Webster's first venture into offering evening
                classes for full-time professionals.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finding it increasingly difficult to finance the college from
                internal resources, the Sisters of Loretto transferred ownership
                of the school to a lay board of directors in 1967. The lay board
                remains in place today, operating Webster as a private,
                nonprofit, non-denominational university.

                The popularity of the evening programs in St. Louis prompted
                Webster College to expand its offerings across the state. In
                1966, Webster offered its first courses outside of St. Louis at
                a campus in Kansas City, Mo. It offered a full Master of Arts
                program there starting in 1973.
              </p>
              <p>
                Webster modeled its Kansas City curriculum after the successful
                Master of Arts in Teaching program launched in St. Louis.
                Although it was geared toward those in the management and
                service-related fields, it kept the intensive nine-week courses
                taught by practicing professionals.
              </p>
              <p>
                Webster College clearly tapped into an unmet educational need at
                this point — a practical higher education option for working
                adults unable to put their lives on hold. The practicality of
                this approach attracted the attention of the U.S. Government. In
                1974, the U.S. Department of Defense invited Webster College to
                become the first to open an extended campus program at Fort
                Sheridan near Chicago. The program provided military personnel a
                convenient location to obtain higher education.
              </p>
              <p>
                The offerings only grew from there. Webster University now
                offers programs at more than 90 locations throughout the United
                States, including at 32 metropolitan campuses, 21 corporate
                sites and 42 military installations.

                In the 1970s, few European universities offered a flexible,
                American-style education. Webster College sought to be one of
                the first. In 1978, Webster opened a campus in Geneva,
                Switzerland, capitalizing on the global perspective the city
                would add to a student's education.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Geneva campus became a popular one, not just for Americans
                looking to study in Europe, but with Europeans seeking an
                American-accredited education. The popularity of the program led
                to the establishment of other European campuses: Vienna,
                Austria; Leiden,the Netherlands; and London, England.
              </p>
              <p>
                Campuses since have been added in Shanghai, China, and
                Cha-Am/Hua Hin, Thailand. These locations add a global
                perspective that stretches across the Webster curriculum.

                The evolution of Webster has taken it well beyond its initial
                days as a small women's liberal arts college. The Webster of
                today operates as a comprehensive, innovative institution of
                higher education. In 1983, the school renamed itself Webster
                University to reflect this development.
              </p>
              <p>
                Webster University expanded the breadth of its offerings by
                creating five distinct schools and colleges: the School of
                Business and Technology; the Leigh Gerdine College of Fine Arts;
                the School of Education; the School of Communications; and the
                College of Arts and Sciences.
              </p>
              <p>
                The university boasts more than 20,000 students at its worldwide
                campuses and more than 101,000 alumni. And although the
                university operates more than 100 locations around the world,
                the home campus of Webster University remains its largest in
                student population and physical size. More than 7,250 students
                study at the 47-acre campus in Webster Groves, Mo.
              </p>
              <p>
                Traditional-aged students. Adult learners. International
                students. Military personnel. Webster University serves them
                all, dedicated to providing quality higher education with small
                class sizes and a blend of theoretical and practical knowledge.
                Excellence in education remains its primary purpose.
